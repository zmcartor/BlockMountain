# Block Mountain

## What
A blockchain explorer for the Ethereum blockchain.


## Why
Blockchain explorers should be funnier. Also a good first project to learn web3.


## Install
Run `npm install` to grab the deps. Serve the directory with `http-server`, or whatever local web-hosting thing you'd like.
Project includes token from INFURA, but these are free and come with no strings attached.
